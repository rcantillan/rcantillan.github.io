I am a Doctoral Candidate in Sociology at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile and Research Assistant at the Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Labor Market Mismatch (LM2C2). My research integrates perspectives from economic sociology, social stratification, and network science to understand labor market dynamics and social inequality. My dissertation analyzes occupational mobility networks through causal inference techniques to understand how relational structures shape labor market opportunities and constraints through diffusion and contagion mechanisms. This innovative approach examines:
