::: {#hero-heading}

::: {.lead}
I am a doctoral candidate in Sociology at the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile and an assistant at the 'Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Labor Market Mismatch' (LM2C2).
:::

My doctoral research uses a structural and network perspective to analyze patterns of mobility, diffusion, and segregation in labor markets from an intragenerational viewpoint. I'm particularly interested in how social networks shape economic outcomes and labor market dynamics.
